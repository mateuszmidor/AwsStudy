*[#Orange] <b>Lambda
 * Invocation\n*Synchronous - CLI, SDK, API Gateway,\nApplication Load Balancer\n*Asynchronous
  * Asynchronous Lambda\n*S3, SNS, CloudWatch Events, ...\n*events are placed on internal queue\n*2x retry on error: after 1 and 2 minutes\n*can process message twice - ensure func is idempotent\n*can define Dead Letter Queue for failed reattempts
   * EventBridge\n*eg. run lambda every minute
   * S3 notifications\n*eg. run lambda on S3 file upload
  * Event Source Mapping (Synchronous)\n*records are POLLED from the source,\nthen lambda is run with event batch\n*lambda needs permission\nto read the event data from source\n*event sources:\n**Kinesis Data Streams\n**DynamoDB Streams\n**SQS queues
   * Streams\n*iterator is created for each shard, process items in order\n*processed items are not removed from the stream\n*on error:\n**by default entire batch is reprocessed until success\nor items in batch expire; this can block your processing!\n**can discard old events\n**can limit number of retries\n**can split the batch (workaround for Lambda timeout issue)\n**discarded events can go to Destination
   * Queues\n*use Long polling with batches 1-10 messages\n*setup DeadLetterQueue with your SQS, not with Lambda;\n DLQ works only with async lambda calls and here is sync calls\n*message may be processed twice event when no error,\n so better ensure idempotency\n*processed messages are deleted from the queue
 * Lambda with Applicatin Load Balancer\n*HTTP request gets to ALB\n*ALB converts HTTP request -> JSON\n*and forwards JSON to EC2 Target Group\n*which returns JSON->HTTP Response->Client\n*Target Group can enable multi-header values\n*conversion of multi-header values:\n**?name=foo&name=bar -> name:[foo, bar]
 * Lambda@Edge\n*modify CloudFront(CDN) requests&responses
 * Destinations\n*to store result/error of async operation somewhere\n*support for SQS, SNS, Lambda, EventBridge bus\n*in case of Lambda - first happen 2 auto retries\n*can be used to replace DeadLetter queue in SQS
 * Execution role\n*allow Lambda function\nto interact with other resource
 * Resource-based policy\n*allow other resource/account\nto run Lambda function
 * VPC\n*by default Lambda runs in dedicated VPC\n outside your own VPC and sso it  can't\n access your other resources eg. DynamoDB\n*the solution is to deploy Lambda in your VPC
  * Lambda in your VPC\n*define VPC ID, Subnets and Security Groups\n*Lambda will create Elastic Network Interface\n (ENI) in your subnets\n*needs: AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole\n*by default, such deployment doesn't give your lambda\n internet access nor public IP\n**even if deployed in Public Subnet!\n*the solution is to use NAT Gateway or NAT Instance\n*to just access other services it's enough to use VPC Endpoints\n*CloudWatch Logs will work ALWAYS no matter what :)
